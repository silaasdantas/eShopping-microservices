# 🛒 E-commerce Microservices Project (In Progress)

This repository contains the source code and project files for the **E-commerce Microservices** project developed during the [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com) titled _"Creating .Net Core Microservices using Clean Architecture using .Net 8 & Angular 18"_.

## 📚 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robust, scalable, and enterprise-ready E-commerce platform using Microservices architecture. This project is designed following Clean Architecture principles and involves the use of various cutting-edge technologies and tools, ensuring high performance, security, and maintainability.

## 🛠️ Key Technologies and Tools Used

- **.NET 8 & C#**: Core development framework for building the Microservices.
- **Clean Architecture**: To ensure maintainable and scalable code structure.
- **Angular 18**: Frontend development framework for building a responsive user interface.
- **Docker & Kubernetes**: Containerization and orchestration tools for efficient Microservices management.
- **Azure AD / Identity Server 4**: For secure authentication and authorization.
- **Rabbit MQ**: Message broker for seamless communication between Microservices.
- **gRPC**: High-performance RPC framework for Microservices communication.
- **Istio Service Mesh**: To manage Microservices traffic and enhance observability.
- **SQL Server, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis**: Databases configured and optimized for different use cases.
- **Azure API Gateway / Ocelot & Nginx**: API Gateway solutions for managing Microservices APIs.
- **Helm Charts**: To simplify the deployment process on Azure.
- **ELK Stack**: For centralized logging, monitoring, and observability.
